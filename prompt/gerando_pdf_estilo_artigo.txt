Create a high-quality, print-ready landing page styled like a magazine or newspaper article. The content should be structured in HTML for A4 portrait print layout, with a clean and elegant editorial tone. Layout and formatting should mimic a feature article from a high-end publication, not a sales page.

Use the following variables:

- {{theme}}: {Culinária}  
- {{title}}: {Como fazer chocolate quente elegante}
- {{additional details or focus}} (optional): {Dicas e receitas com toques disruptivos, ingredientes pouco convencionais para melhor apresentação e degustação}
- {{min_word_count}}: {20000}
- {{language}} : {pt-BR}
- {{author_reference}} (style inspiration): {Camila Cardoso}
- {{related_books}} (to use as stylistic and structural context): {Finanças para garotas; Constituição, constitucionalismo e direitos undamentais}

### Requirements:

1. **Language and Volume**  
   - Write all content in {{language}}  
   - Ensure a minimum of {{min_word_count}} words

2. **Stylistic Reference**  
   - Emulate the tone and narrative rhythm of {{author_reference}}, using {{related_books}} as structural and emotional references.  
   - Maintain a voice appropriate to editorial journalism or premium print magazines.

3. **Design and Layout**  
   - Structure the content as a clean, semantically correct HTML page suitable for A4 printing  
   - Use tags like `<section>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<blockquote>`, `<ul>`, etc., with simple inline styles if necessary for layout consistency  
   - Do not include CSS files or JavaScript—keep it lightweight and printable

4. **Images and Prompt Output (Dynamic + Local Reference)**  
   - Dynamically generate image prompts **only where they enhance understanding or visual storytelling**  
   - Each time an image is needed:
     - Insert the **image prompt text** using this placeholder (to be saved separately):  
       `<!-- imgN.txt: [prompt description] -->`  
     - Then, embed the local image with the following HTML:  
       `<img src="images/imgN.jpg" alt="Illustration for section N" style="max-width:100%; margin: 20px 0;" />`
     - Number images sequentially as `img1`, `img2`, etc., **in the order they are used in the document**

5. **Content Blocks**  
   a. **Title & Subtitle**  
      - Use `<h1>` for the title: {{title}}  
      - Add a short emotional or thematic subtitle in a `<p>` or `<h2>` tag

   b. **Intro Section**  
      - One or two paragraphs introducing {{theme}} and linking it emotionally or intellectually to the reader  
      - Insert image if helpful in setting context

   c. **Main Article Body (3–4 sections)**  
      - Use `<h2>` for subheadings, followed by 1–3 paragraphs per section  
      - Insert images in **varied positions**:
        - Sometimes before the section
        - Sometimes after a paragraph
        - Sometimes floating left/right using `<img style="float:right; margin-left:20px; max-width:40%;">` or similar

   d. **Insights List**  
      - Add a `<ul>` list with 4–6 key takeaways or benefits the reader gains from engaging with the theme

   e. **Pull-Quote / Highlight**  
      - Include a reflective or motivational quote in a `<blockquote>` with soft emphasis

   f. **Conclusion**  
      - A short final section (1–2 paragraphs) that reflects on the topic and inspires the reader—no promotion

6. **Restrictions**  
   - Do NOT include: author names, purchase links, buttons, forms, calls to action, marketing phrases  
   - Do NOT mention the image prompt text directly in the article—only as HTML comments for internal generation

7. **File Structure Expected**  
   - For each image inserted, generate the image prompt as a comment like:  
     `<!-- img3.txt: A metaphorical illustration of focus and chaos in a modern office setting, minimalist style -->`  
   - The image itself should be referenced with:  
     `<img src="images/img3.jpg" alt="..." />`  
   - This allows external tools to extract and generate images from the `imgN.txt` files and place them in `images/imgN.jpg`

The final result should feel like a beautifully crafted feature article in a thematic print magazine, rich in insights and visually balanced. Refresh the prompts to generate images, relate then with the context.
